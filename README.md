Virtual Pet
=============

In this project you will write a program using [Processing](https://processing.org) that displays any animal of your choosing. You can use almost any drawing functions that you would like, you can find the full list at the [Processing Reference](https://processing.org/reference) (See note below).  Your program will need to be divided into at least two functions `void setup()` and `void draw()`. 

When you are happy with the appearance of your virtual pet, you will post your finished program on a website. You can get a free [GitHub](https://github.com) account for your website. Instructions on how to put your program on a GitHub website are on slides 73-86 of the [apjavaProcessing slide presentation]([https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sqbareaFmF9fMcp0XOl3hRO6hAlrU5WIaj4V-Kd3eDI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fHPXtX7vxOkjD1HNgr7T-RcwrmhYryWJDt6Y8Sk83u0/edit?usp=sharing)). Submit the link to your website on google classroom.

+ `square()`
+ `clear()`
+ `delay()`
+ `System.out.println()`
